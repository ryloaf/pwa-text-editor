# PWA Text Editor Challenge

  ## Description

My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

  ## Usage

  1. Follow the Render link to the deployed application.
  2. Click the install button in the search bar.
  3. Begin typing to your heart's content.

  ## Technologies

  1. Progressive Web Applications (PWA)
  2. Express
  3. Webpack
  4. Node.js
